# About

A parallel approach, based on a set of successful algorithms, for real-time simulation of the interaction of fluids with rigid bodies. The method is based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and developed within a heterogeneous multi-core CPU and GPU architecture. 

Our discretisation of polygonal model into a set of particles is made by using a modified version of depth peeling, which was originally used for rendering transparent polygons. The technique has also been applied to various other operations related to collision detection and polygonal discretisation.

In order to compile the project, it is necessary to use the [jrfxgl](https://github.com/josericardojr/jrfxgl) engine.
